# Vocal-Simulink-Architect
An innovative framework that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to translate vocal commands into functional Simulink block diagrams. This project bridges the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and the MATLAB API to automate system design, reducing manual modeling time and enhancing engineering workflows.
